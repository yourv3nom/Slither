the MITM part of the script was able to be written thanks to an online tutorial.
once i learned it all, i added a sniffer to the script allowing the user to be able to sniff all the victim traffic
WITHOUT haveing to open a new tutorial and tcpdump or even using a sniffer in general.
the perks of my script is that when you do sniff, it will ONLY SNIFF VICTIM TRAFFIC and not your own :)
this is possible due to threading so i could run two functions at once, sniffing and keeping the MITM established.
hope you enjoy this script <3
